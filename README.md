# Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-Exercises

This repository contains Python implementations for various Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab assignments. Each folder corresponds to a specific lab exercise and includes the required Python code files.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 1: Exercise on Python
- Basic Python exercises covering foundational programming concepts.

### Lab 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Implementation of BFS and DFS algorithms for graph traversal.

### Lab 3: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.

### Lab 4: Decision Tree
- Implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using a simple dataset.

### Lab 5: Shopping Data
- Analysis and classification of shopping data using Python.

### Lab 6: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Question:** Implement a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch in Python. The implementation supports:
  - Discrete (categorical) data.
  - Continuous (Gaussian) data.
- Example datasets: Iris or Titanic.

### Lab 7: Genetic Algorithm (Part 1)
- Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for optimization problems.

### Lab 8: Genetic Algorithm (Part 2)
- Extended implementation of the Genetic Algorithm with additional features or examples.

### Lab 9: Fuzzy Sets
- **Question:** Create a fuzzy control system for temperature regulation using the Zadeh Max-Min method.
  - Inputs: Temperature (Low, Medium, High).
  - Outputs: Fan Speed (Slow, Medium, Fast).
  - Implement fuzzy rules and apply the Max-Min method to infer the output.

### Lab 10: Fuzzy Control System
- Implementation of fuzzy logic techniques for practical control systems.
